# Capstone
Active Anti-Roll Bar Control

This code is part of the 2020 Schulich Racing Capstone project tasked with creating an active ARB to improve vehicle handling within corners and therefore decrease lap times. 

The code is split into two main folders:

Capstone_Spreadsheet_Verification 
This code is used to verify that the system is behaving properly. It runs a procedure to collect experimental pressure and force data that can then be compared to previously determined analytical values.

Main_Code:
This code is used to run the system. It is designed for system verification on the testing apparatus and for on-vehicle implementation.
